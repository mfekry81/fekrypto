## üîß Technical Implementation

### Signal Logic
The application implements sophisticated trading signal detection based on your specifications:

**BUY Conditions (Bullish):**
- EMA 9 crosses above EMA 20 (first signal, even if both below EMA 50)
- EMA 9 above EMA 20 and EMA 9 touches EMA 50 (bullish bounce)
- EMA 20 above EMA 50 (trend confirmation for strong signals)

**SELL Conditions (Bearish):**
- EMA 9 crosses below EMA 20 (first signal, even if both above EMA 50)
- EMA 9 below EMA 20 and EMA 9 touches EMA 50 (bearish rejection)
- EMA 20 below EMA 50 (trend confirmation for strong signals)

**Potential Signals:**
- EMAs within 0.2% of each other (potential cross imminent)
- Cross occurred but waiting for trend confirmation

### Enhanced Analysis
- **Stoch RSI Confirmation:** Adds 10% confidence when aligned with signal direction
- **MACD Confirmation:** Adds 10% confidence when MACD line above/below signal line
- **Confidence Scoring:** 50-100% confidence levels for signal strength
